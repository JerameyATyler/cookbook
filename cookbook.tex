\section{Introduction}
Prepare your face for a roundhouse kick of flavor right in the taste buds. These recipes are so full of flavor they are illegal in 47 states. Not for pregnant women, those with weak hearts, or communists.

\section{Hearty}
These are cold weather recipes for me. For many of them I'll get up early and throw it in the slow cooker before I head to campus. A lot of these can be frozen and eaten again later.

\section{Comfort Food}
Ummm. These are foods that take me to a happy place. They remind me of childhood.
